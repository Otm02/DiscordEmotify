# Getting started

Welcome! DiscordEmotify lets you bulk-react to Discord messages with an emoji via GUI or CLI.

If you still have questions after reading this page or encounter a problem, see [FAQ & Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md).

## GUI or CLI?

- GUI â€” easiest for newcomers; pick channels, choose emoji, run.
- CLI â€” best for automation and power users.

Guides:

- [Using the GUI](Using-the-GUI.md)
- [Using the CLI](Using-the-CLI.md)

## Requirements

- A Discord token (user or bot). See [Token and IDs](Token-and-IDs.md).
- Emoji to apply: Unicode (ðŸ™‚), shortcode (`:smile:`), or custom (`name:123456789012345678`).
